# Introduction

At the very beginning of an article in The New Yorker, @wiener2019 wrote a sentence that impressed me:

> Open-plan offices offer few pleasures; one of them is snooping on other people’s browsing habits. When, years ago, I began working for tech companies in San Francisco, I noticed that my co-workers were always scrolling through a beige, text-only Web site that resembled a nineteen-nineties Internet forum. They were reading Hacker News—a link aggregator and message board that is something of a Silicon Valley institution.

Even though this article was intended to discuss Hacker News, it elicited a concerning issue that matters in workspace: privacy. Today, If you step into a business building, chances are that you will see an open-plan office design, instead of traditional cellular offices. Millions of people around the world have to work in open-plan offices, where everything they do is visible to everybody else [@kellaway2013]. According to the estimation of the International Facility Management Association and Corenet Global, more than 70% office workers in the US work in an open office environment, and 74% of the surveyed people said they’re more concerned about their privacy now than they were 10 years ago [@congdon2014].

In the meanwhile, over the past decades, work has changed from an industrial economy to a knowledge-based one globally [@greene2011]. As a consequence, more employees are knowledge workers instead of traditional skills-based workers, who require a more privacy-friendly and distraction-free environment to work efficiently.

It’s obvious that the primary reason why managers in companies love open-plan offices rather than private offices lies in the cheaper price [@kellaway2013]. However, these financial benefits could be offset by the intangible costs associated with the negative effects on workers [@james2021]. Let us explore what the negative effects of open-plan offices are, and how they are identified in the academic literature.
